# Commercial Project: BirD

## Overview

This project aims to classify animals in motion detected videos captured in Singapore. The methodology used in this project involves exploring the use of YOLOv7 to fine tune the classification model. In addition, data augmentation techniques will be employed to enhance the model's accuracy.

## Methodology

To achieve accurate classification, we are exploring the use of YOLOv7 to fine tune the model. This approach involves training the model on a supervised dataset of common Singaporean animals. Then, by fine tuning the model with frames from the real videos, we can identify real animals in the videos. The use of YOLOv7 allows us to achieve high accuracy and fast processing times.

## Data Augmentation

To further enhance the accuracy of the model, we plan to create "fake" night vision videos to train on since the camera has night vision videos. This data augmentation technique will help the model recognize animals in low-light settings, improving its performance.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project aims to develop a robust animal classification model that can accurately identify animals in motion detected videos captured in Singapore. Through the use of YOLOv7 and data augmentation techniques, we aim to achieve high accuracy and fast processing times.
